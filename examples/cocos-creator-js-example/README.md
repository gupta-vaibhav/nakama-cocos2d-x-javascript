To build this example, build it through Cocos Creator's `build` button and run it via the `run` button or `cd` into `build/jsb-default` and use the `cocos run` command with the platform of your choice, e.g., `cocos run -p ios`


Note: To run in the XCode 12 on the iOS simulator, you must set append the 'x86_64' architecture to the VALID_ARCHS build setting in both the Cocos and Example ios targets.

This example is intended for use in Cocos Creator 2.3.4.
